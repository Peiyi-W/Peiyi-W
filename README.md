I'm a third-year student in the Mathematics and Statistics - Stats Spec Program with a strong passion for problem-solving and statistical analysis.  
I'm skilled in Python and SQL and have a strong interest in data analysis and data science.  
I'm currently on the lookout for a Winter 2025 Co-op opportunity in these fields.
